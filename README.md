I am financial accountant who has taken an interest in the tech field and have recently completed a data science bootcamp with HyperionDev.
So far the only data science, coding and software engineering experience I have is from the bootcamp. All I have ever known since high school is commerce subjects and thats why I went on to do my undergrad in Financial Accountant.
I have worked as financial administrator for a hotel chain, worked as a claims administrator for a life insurance organisation and also worked as a financial accountant for a supply chain consulting company.

I am passionate about all things tech related as of late. The world seems to be moving in a more technologically advance direction and I am always one to make the necessary changes to keep up with the times. I would like to combine my experience in finance with my new found skill as a data science and hopefully end up in the fintech space as a quantitative analyst at a bank. I am particularly excited by the finance industry's use of machine learning and AI algorithms in everyday use and would like to sow my seeds in this new but ever growing field.
